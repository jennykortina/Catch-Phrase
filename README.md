Catch-Phrase
============

Clone of Catch Phrase I wrote to run on Arduino.  

catchphrase programmer - XLS sheet used to easily generate word list into format for program.

catchPhrase.ino - code that runs on Arduino.  Need to add scrambling of words, and have where the user leaves off in array stored in EPROM.

Misc - pic of project and instructions for rules of normal Catch Phrase game.

Schematics - all the wiring diagrams for hardware.
